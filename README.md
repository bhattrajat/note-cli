# note-cli
A simple note-cli app created with Node.js

## Installation
- Clone this repo
- Use `npm link` to add a symlink (I will work on creating this a globally installable npm package in the future)

## Usage
- Use note --help to see all the commands and features

## Features
- It uses an SQLite database under the hood to store the notes for faster query time.
- (Working on) Creating a server and server all notes using Express.
- (In future) Create this as an installable npm package.
